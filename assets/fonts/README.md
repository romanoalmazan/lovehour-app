# Font Setup

To use the Cinnamon Cake font:

1. Download the Cinnamon Cake font file (usually named `CinnamonCake.ttf`, `CinnamonCake-Regular.ttf`, or similar)
2. Place the font file in this directory (`assets/fonts/`)
3. If the font file has a different name, update the font loading in `App.tsx` to match the filename

The font will be automatically loaded when the app starts.
